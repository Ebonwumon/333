Encryption key: group4

1) Inspect the contents of the .enc files.
a) Sizes
Plaintext: 80 bytes
ECB and CBC: 88 bytes
CFB and OFB: 80 bytes

b) Patterns
ECB: Identical ciphertext blocks. This is because ecb divides the plaintext into 8 byte blocks
and encrypts each separately. But each block is encrypted with the same key, so trying to encrypt blocks
of plaintext that are the same produces identical ciphertext blocks.

CBC: No patterns or similarities to ciphertext encrypted with other forms of DES.

CFB and OFB: No patterns in individual ciphertext files. However the first 8 bytes of both the files had
the same ciphertext. This is because they are both initially encrypted in the same way, but the next 8 bytes are
XORed at different points during encryption. 

2) Impact of "error" on decryption.
ECB: Entire 3rd block 

3) Ciphertext3 observations.
